      - Fix CSS bug that created an unpannable part of the map next to the
        category list.

      - Convert open/closed status stuff to use categories instead.  For
        backwards compatibility, datafiles using open: yes and open: no will
        be treated as if they had category: open and category:closed instead.
        For now, everything must be in one and only one category.
      - As part of the above, some of the Javascript has changed.  If you have
        custom map.tt or map_js.tt templates, please check them against the
        distribution templates and incorporate the changes.
      - Some of the CSS has also changed, so please check your main.css too.

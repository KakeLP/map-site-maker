* Put your Flickr key and secret in conf/flickr.conf
Keep this secret!  Do not share it with anyone!


* Put other variables in conf/mapsite.conf:

base_url = the root URL of the site, e.g. http://londonbookshops.org/

datafile = the location of the datafile, e.g. /home/kake/data/bookshops.yaml
(note that currently this must be a YAML file)

entity_type = a single word (underscores/hyphens allowed) that describes
the type of thing you're modelling in the plural (e.g. "shops", "pubs").
This is used to form URLs e.g. http://londonbookshops.org/shops/gosh.html

kml_filename = a filename for the KML that will be generated
(e.g. bookshops.kml).  This will default to $entity_type.kml

site_name = a pretty title for the site, e.g. London Bookshop Map

* The site will be generated in site/ - every time you run "generate", this
directory will be created if necessary and cleared out if necessary.

MapSite - A set of tools for turning datafiles into a map-enabled website
based on static HTML and Javascript.


* Put your Flickr key and secret in conf/flickr.conf
Keep this secret!  Do not share it with anyone!


* Put other variables in conf/mapsite.conf:

base_url = the root URL of the site, e.g. http://londonbookshops.org/

datafile = the location of the datafile, e.g. /home/kake/data/bookshops.yaml
(note that currently this must be a YAML file)

entity_type = a single word (underscores/hyphens allowed) that describes
the type of thing you're modelling in the plural (e.g. "shops", "pubs").
This is used to form URLs e.g. http://londonbookshops.org/shops/gosh.html

kml_filename = a filename for the KML that will be generated
(e.g. bookshops.kml).  This will default to $entity_type.kml

site_description = a sentence or two describing the site.  This is used
in e.g. the meta element in the header.  Defaults to something generic.
You probably want to put a full stop at the end.

site_name = a pretty title for the site, e.g. London Bookshop Map


* To amend the templates, create a directory called custom_templates/, copy
the templates you want to amend from templates/ to custom_templates/, and
edit the copies in custom_templates/.  (Things in templates/ may get
overwritten when you upgrade the mapsite maker.)


* If you want anything copied over directly to the site, put it in static/
Note that if you use filenames the same as generated files, the static files
will be overwritten in site/ with the generated ones.  Similarly, if you
use any filenames used in assets/ then your files will be overwritten in site/.
Note also that this doesn't exclude e.g. emacs backup files - it just copies
them over like any other file.


* The site will be generated in site/ - every time you run "generate", this
directory will be created if necessary and cleared out if necessary.
